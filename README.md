# DESCRIPTION

Improve Search on fanfiction(script).

**THIS SCRIPT USING HEAVILY ![WEB SCRAPING](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping), USE ON YOUR OWN RISK!**

Don't have time to make screenshots, but here is how to use:
1) Visit fandom with fanfics then click "Fetch fanfics".
2) Wait for fetching all fanfics(do  **NOT** use website on this tab and on others!), it will take time depending on how many fanfics got fandom(Highly recommend do **NOT** use this script with more than 20000 fanfics, it not just take "forever" but will slow down your browser).
3) After click on "Search fanfics", sometimes it will complete freeze your browser you need just wait(That's why I'm not recommended Fetch huge fandoms!)

P.s Maybe if I got time, will make server based script, but I don't have currently time and server.
